# Write a program that computes Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.

# In Pascal's Triangle each number is computed by adding the numbers to the

#  1 3 3 1
# 1 4 6 4 1

# first row is [1]
# seconde row is [1, 1]

# the first and last elems of each row is always 1.
# the nth row has n number of elements
